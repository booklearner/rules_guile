# rules_guile

[Bazel](https://bazel.build) rules for [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/). The goal is allow users to declare and fetch guile dependencies in git repositories and `zip`/`tar` http archives in a project using Bazel as the build tool. One advantage is the ability to import a C library and build it in the same environment from source using [`rules_foreign_cc`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc).
